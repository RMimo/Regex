# Regex

This repository contains code and exercises from my ongoing journey into mastering regular expressions (regex). It focuses on exploring different regex patterns and techniques to deepen my understanding and enhance my skills in string pattern matching. Regular expressions are highly useful for extracting information from various types of text, such as code, log files, spreadsheets, and documents, and this repository includes experiments with common regex use cases and advanced pattern matching techniques.
